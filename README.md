In this challenge, we created filters for the filters for the webpage. The new filtering method will allow users to filter using multiple factors. As an extentention of the webpage Dana wanted the table to be filtered further by date, ciity, state, country, and shape. To allow the user to filter, we used the new function that saves the element, value, and the id of the filter that was changed. In addition, we created an if-else statement to add filter data from input, or clear the filter if no input data exits. We also created a function that filtered data to the table, looped through all filters and kept any data that matches the filter values. Lastly, we created a funtion to allow user to pick changes using d3.selectAll().
