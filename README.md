# UFOs

In this project, we created filters for a webpage using javascript. Using the HTML code, we developed our website, added data, backgund, images to the website. For the challenege portion, we used a new filtering method will allow users to filter using multiple factors. As an extentention of the webpage Dana wanted the table to be filtered further by date, ciity, state, country, and shape. To allow the user to filter, we used the new function that saves the element, value, and the id of the filter that was changed. In addition, we created an if-else statement to add filter data from input, or clear the filter if no input data exits. We also created a function that filtered data to the table, looped through all filters and kept any data that matches the filter values. Lastly, we created a funtion to allow user to pick changes using d3.selectAll(). 

Although the website is very userful to our users, we can make futher changes to futher develop the website. The website has too many inputs the user needs to make. One recommnedation is allow the user to search by only what they want and they can choose from on date, city, state, country, and shape. Instead of having different fields, the user can select how they want to search. This would make the website look more clean.
